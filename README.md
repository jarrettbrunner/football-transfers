# football-transfers
This is a project that I decided to do using data analysis and machine learning on a dataset I found on kaggle containing the top 250 transfers in world football (soccer) over the last ~20 seasons. I am a big fan of the sport and wanted to practice and showcase my skills, so I decided to work on this project. I have performed some data cleaning and aggregating, constructed a number of cool visualizations in the process of my analysis, and have optimized a Random Forest to predict a player's transfer fee based on other attributes (leagues involved, teams involved, age of the player, position of the player etc). The entire analysis exists in "Football Transfers.ipynb", but because that file is very long, I have broken it down into three sections. These are "Initial Exploration and Cleaning.ipynb", "Visualizations.ipynb", and "Machine Learning.ipynb". Additionally, if you're interested in performing your own analysis on this dataset, I have included the zip file of the dataset. Feel free to use any of my code.
